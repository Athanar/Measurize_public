# Measurize

This repository is the implementation for the site Measurize.dk, which is a personal project. The goal is to learn as many relevant technologies as possible in order to implement a site capable of collecting and working with data. Similarly it should eventually be scalable enough to handle medium to large user flows, with a large amount of database interactions each.

The site itself is made to be able to measure various stats on a daily basis, with daily resets. Initially the thought is to make it as modifiable as possible, allowing for measures of whatever format the user sees fit. Eventually templates should be available for a quicker startup. Examples of areas to track could be health, work, school, sleep or just daily tasks. The main twist of the site is the possibility of valuing all trackable inputs, which allows for priorizing tasks, and potentially opens up for suggestions annd features derived from that line of thinking.

At the moment the site is still a far way off from being able to live up to this, as it is a solo project and given how i've had to learn all but a few of the concepts myself. But there are working features, which technically makes it possible to track values and get some basic statistics as well as set basic overall goals.
